# Regularized Linear Regression Study - EDA + Model Training

Using U.S country level sociodemographic and health resource data (2018-2019) I've performed an EDA and then trained it using Ridge and Lasso Lr Models.

This project goal was to understand and see how Regularized Linear Regressions works as a method of supervised learning. 
The data for this project was very deep but actually very good to train a Regularized LR. I've worked with 36 Features to train the model, but using K-Best I let the computer select the best 36 features. Here's a look at the heatmap of correlations:

The Regularized Linear Regression lead to a very good accuracy, and trying with Lasso did not improve. 

This was a good exercise to deal with a lot of features.
